# URL Shortener
WIP Repository / non-functional

## Description
This repository contains the code for my personal URL shortening service (like [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/), or [goo.gl](https://goo.gl/)).
My goal is it, to learn more about building websites with MaterializeCSS and backends with Go, as well as key-value stores.
